	description = We argued that our 1.25m fuel tanks didn't clash nearly as dramatically as our 2.5m tanks, but the Prakasa reps still seemed awfully perturbed by the rims we put on them. Parasitic drag, they said, though their expressions suggested to us that it was every bit as much about pretty lines as it was about airflow.
