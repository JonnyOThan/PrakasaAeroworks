	description = Frankly we really didn't think we needed this one, but several Prakasa representatives visibly cringed when they saw one of their sleek gray pods mounted on our gaudy orange monolith. Insistance that the orange color made it go faster was met with further cringing. Sometime later they returned with this and called it complimentary; they seem to think rockets are an art, which we suppose is fine with us.
