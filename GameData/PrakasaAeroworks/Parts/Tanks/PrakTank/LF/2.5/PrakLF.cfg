	description = Oxidizer is really a terrific thing. Don't want to eat your vegetables? Burn them as fuel! Pop a tire on the way to the space center? Burn it as fuel! Tired of paperwork? Burn it as fuel! That said, sometimes oxidizer does get a little in the way. We're not really sure why we couldn't just unify the tanks we already had, but having Prakasa take care of it certainly beats making new ones from scratch.
