	description = Our xenon propulsion systems struck us the most responsible we've ever designed. As they don't seem to be quite so technologically shackled as we are, we went to Prakasa for a way to make them irresponsible. One can store an awful lot of gaseous xenon in a relatively small space, and with the speeds the particles are accelerated to, a little goes a long way. If that's so, then a lot goes a really, really, really, really, long way. Well this is a lot, and it boasts a convenient profile against the Savadhan. Hopefully that's worth the irresponsible price tag.
