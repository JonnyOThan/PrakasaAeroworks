	description = Have lots and lots of friends? Friend capacity of Prakasa command modules not quite meeting your needs? Are you tired of third party modules dooming your friends to stare at the roots of your center-mounted wings rather than the unending expanse of the universe? Prakasa has committed all their aerodynamic geniuses to this one project to solve all your wing-root related problems: A not-quite-a-cylinder! With Windows not in the middle! Truly this is a groundbreaking feet of aerospace engineering. Includes snacks courtesy of the project lead's grandmother; she promised they weren't fish-based this time. Troublesome nooks provided for your storage convenience.
