	description = The Prakasa representatives we spoke with spent a long time discussing this thing they called wave drag. Only one of our engineers actually stayed awake. Apparently it has something to do with smooth, shallow curves and breaking the sound barrier. We were told this thing would help us do that whenever we wanted to mount smaller engines onto bigger fuselages, so rather than listen to another lecture we bought it. Looking at it now, we're not sure if we couldn't have accomplished the same thing by picking a tail section and drilling a hole in it.
