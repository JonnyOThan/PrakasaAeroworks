	description = When Prakasa told us this new offering of theirs would change the way we looked at space travel, we didn't think they were being anywhere near this literal. Never has vertigo come in such a small package! Space is at a premium, but awe, pensive reflection, and existential terror abound. The designers seem to think all those things are uniquely desirable; we're not sure how we feel about it yet.
