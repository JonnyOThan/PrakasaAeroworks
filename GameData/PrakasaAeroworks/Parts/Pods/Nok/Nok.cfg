	description = She may not be as spacious or as comfy as Jalakag, but Nok boasts a slightly better crew capacity thanks to an included cabin, and a pair of nice, sleek intakes. If you'd like to go fast and swallow air and you aren't too clasuterphobic or dependant on creature comforts, boy is this the cockpit for you. Despite the angle grinder marks, representatives insist it was not in fact cut off a retired heavy fighter.
