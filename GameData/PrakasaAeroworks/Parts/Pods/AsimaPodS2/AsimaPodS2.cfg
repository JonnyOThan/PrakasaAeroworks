	description = Like the Asima command module? Have more than two friends? It turns out Prakasa has you covered. This upscaled pod boasts room for you and up to six friends to romp about the universe with, though just how much of the universe depends on how good you are at going very fast/hacking said universe. Highly reccomended for groups of the astronomically inclined looking to capitalize on their wanderlust. It occured to us it could also be used as an extremely expensive sitcom set; the designers reluctantly agreed, though the suggestion seemed to worry them. One made us promise to give it a good home; we're not sure if that's legally binding. Tip: During long transfers, hang a basketball hoop from the upper bridge. It offers terrific pretext for throwing spherical objects at the captain.
