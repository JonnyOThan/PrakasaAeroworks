	description = Some time ago we had a nice, slim little single seat cockpit particularly suitable to small craft or, better yet, gluing to gigantic craft through a contrived mass of components. Unfortunately, this was some time ago. Nobody seems to be sure just where it went, but we checked in all the closets and under all the beds and came up empty handed. Prakasa was quick to substitute, and the engineers there were even kind enough to include an intake free of charge.
