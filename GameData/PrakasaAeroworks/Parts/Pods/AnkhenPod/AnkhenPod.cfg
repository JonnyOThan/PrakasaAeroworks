	description = Whoever these guys are, they must really be into water. First the fishy snacks, and now this whale thing. Several of our xenobiologists, overjoyed to be working with something actually xeno, have speculated that the mysterious proprietors of the Prakasa corporation might even be some kind of fish themselves; that would make more sense if we didn't keep finding fur in the carpets and air filters. When we asked them about this pod's peculiar shape we were told it was designed in the image of an mythological hero of theirs whose name we probably shouldn't bother trying to pronounce. Evidently at least he was a whale thing. We threw some xenoanthropologists at the matter too, so far "Whale Things? Fluffy things? Both?" Is as far as we've gotten. It probably doesn't help that we made up their discipline on the spot when we hired them; at least one was a regular anthropologist before then. Whatever they are, the snacks they sent us were pretty good this time around, and their mythological hero has excellent visibility!
