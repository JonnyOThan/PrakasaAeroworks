	description = It's amazing just how much space you can save by feeding your hungry engines with your cockpit. Even more amazing are the pretty, sweeping lines you get when you find places to cram the intakes. This new offering from Prakasa supposedly offers not only the best engine feeding but also prettiest lines, according to one Irek Katyn. He assures us he totally wasn't the designer. Initially called something that started with N and had lots of a's and k's, When they showed us the design our engineers commented that it looked like a confused snake, and it came back with the name Bhatak Naga.
