	description = A sleek four-seat cockpit with integrated living accomidations and snacks sold by the mysterious Prakasa Corporation. We've never actually seen the proprietors, and when they show they insist on singing all the time. Make a good spaceship though, if a little crampt on the inside. Clearly they aren't shaped quite like us. The snacks that came with it tasted like fish so we replaced them with our own, better snacks.
