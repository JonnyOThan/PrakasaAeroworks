	description = A bulky but sleek Prakasa pod adapted to the mk3 profile. Its primary purpose appears to be looking at things, what with the massive window and spectroscopy lab in the bow. With accomidations for such a large crew, it took our top engineers days to replace the fishy-tasting snacks with our superior snacks. The clean rooms are horrifically contimated by crumbs, but we got it done.
