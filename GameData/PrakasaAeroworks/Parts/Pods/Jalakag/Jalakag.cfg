	description = Freshly imported from the stars at a TERRIFIC price, this "Jalakag" arrived at KSC smelling like salt, fish, and rum. Your mass spectrometers suggest it may already have been to Laythe and maybe a few dozen other planets, but you don't want to jump to any conclusions. After careful study you've found it supports a crew compliment of five. Initial hose tests suggest it's as watertight as our vendors say it is.
