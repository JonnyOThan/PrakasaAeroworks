	description = A favorite of field scientists and wandering poets alike, the Lahar'Pakshe, while not as posh as Kalpana, has the advantage of being brand new and not adapted from a century old design. She's watertight, spacetight, and infinitely practical. If you can get around some tight quarters and have some experience decorating dorm rooms, then this cockpit is ready to bring you the experience of being couped up on a boat in space or on the water.
