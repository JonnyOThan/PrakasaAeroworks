	description = A slightly cramped spacecraft pod with solid visability marketed by the Prakasa corporation as an entry-level charriot for the astronomically inclined. Grab a few friends, blaze a few trails, they said. We commented that it might be a little crampt for those longer transfers; they reccomended partying to pass the time. They must have taken their own advice, because we keep finding paper plates in cupboards and snack crumbs in the carpet.
