	description = In what scientists are calling "really lame", this new offering from Prakasa doesn't seem to provide any snack storage. It does, however, seem to provide copious volumes of visibility. Better to watch the stars, they said, and the runways. In addition to the superior potential for basking in the beauty of the cosmos, this pod also is equipped with sizeable structural intakes for feeding hungry engines. We dispatched an inquiry as to why the flight deck couldn't be equipped to feed hungry Kerbals as well; they told us the structure was just too lean for such frivious things as cabinets and suggested we store them elsewhere. Public Relations thinks we might have offended them by replacing their fishy snacks. Maybe we'll send them a gift basket.
