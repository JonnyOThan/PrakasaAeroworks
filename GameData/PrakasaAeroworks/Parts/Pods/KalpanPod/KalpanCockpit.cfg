	description = A blunted two-seat cockpit with generous space and accomidations sold by the mysterious Prakasa Corporation. We're pretty sure they said something about it not being rated for use in a vaccum because of something to do with windows and internal pressure, but we were too busy noticing the rare instance of conversational speech for what it was to know for sure. Our engineers suppose there's only one way to find out. We weren't offered a warranty anyway.
