	description = Despite the technical marvel of our dawn thruster, proposals to cluster them into massive nacelles for our larger interplanetary vehicles were dismissed as "ugly" and "bendy". Some concern was even raised as to the environmental risk associated with the way our more complicated structures tend to slow the entire universe down and make it moove jerkily. Evidently the Prakasa reps weren't overjoyed with the cluster system either, as recently we were offered this thing. It's awfully electron-thirsty, but no more than our own systems when it comes down to thrust. The more we look at it the more it seems like a cluster of about eighteen of the things. It's certainly sleeker though, and it saves us loads of money and mass on girders. Sounds like a shrieking eel at high throttle settings; we've yet to work out if it grows louder when it's about to feed.
