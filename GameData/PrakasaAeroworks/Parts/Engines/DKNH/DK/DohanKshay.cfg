	description = Rockets work by making things go fast. Usually we make things go fast by reacting them to each other, but we've also tried energizing them electrically and getting them really, really hot and expanding them that way. So far we only tried getting our liquid fuel really hot, but Prakasa seems to have developed their systems to get just about anything really hot. We couldn't afford most of the solutions they use on domestic vessels, but this engine was a bargain. It's not so powerful as their domestic models, but promises to get not just liquid fuel, but even the air itself really hot.
